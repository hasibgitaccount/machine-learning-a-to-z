‚úÖ Math & Concepts You Should Know for DSA
(These are before you deep-dive into LeetCode)

1. Basic Math Skills (Fundamentals)
Arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Fractions, Percentages, Ratios
Powers, Exponents, Modulo operations
e.g. a % b is often used in hashing, number theory problems
Floor, Ceil, Rounding
Useful in binary search, etc.
2. Number Theory Basics (Optional but Helps!)
Prime Numbers (Sieve of Eratosthenes)
Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), Least Common Multiple (LCM)
Modular Arithmetic
Modular inverses, especially in hashing, cryptography problems (optional for beginners)
3. Sequences and Series
Arithmetic Progressions (AP)
Geometric Progressions (GP)
Summations (Œ£ notation)
Helpful for time complexity analysis
Factorials (n!)
Used in permutations/combinations
4. Recursion & Recurrence
Mathematical Induction
Understand the concept; you "think recursively"
Recurrence Relations
Solve them (optional at the start), but understand how they work (Fibonacci, etc.)
Recursive Thinking
Breaking down problems into smaller subproblems (divide and conquer)
5. Combinatorics & Probability (Optional but Helpful)
nCr, nPr (Combinations/Permutations)
Useful in backtracking and combinatorial problems
Basic Probability
Optional unless solving probabilistic or expected value problems
Sometimes shows up in Dynamic Programming (e.g., expected outcomes)
6. Graph Theory Basics (Optional for Starting DSA, but Core Later)
Vertices and Edges
Graphs, Trees
Basic Understanding of BFS/DFS (Search Algorithms)
Covered in DSA but helps if you grasp the graph concept before
(You‚Äôll learn algorithms like Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall later)
‚úÖ Computer Science Concepts You Should Know for DSA
(Don't worry, these are what you‚Äôll learn alongside the math!)

1. Recursion
Base case + Recursive case
Tail Recursion vs Non-Tail
Recursive Trees
Know how recursion breaks down problems
2. Big O Notation (Time and Space Complexity)
What is O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n log n)?
Analyze basic loops and recursion for time complexity
3. Data Structures
Arrays
Strings
Linked Lists
Stacks & Queues
HashMaps / Dictionaries / HashTables
Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
Graphs
Heaps (Priority Queues)
Tries (Optional at the beginning)
4. Algorithms
Sorting algorithms
Bubble, Selection, Insertion (basic)
Merge Sort, Quick Sort (divide and conquer)
Searching algorithms
Linear Search, Binary Search
Recursion and Backtracking
Dynamic Programming (advanced)
Greedy Algorithms
Graph Algorithms
BFS, DFS
Dijkstra‚Äôs, Kruskal‚Äôs (later)
‚úÖ Programming Skills You Need
(Already learning Python‚Äîgreat choice!)

Control Flow
Loops (for, while)
Conditional Statements (if, else)
Functions and Recursion
Basic OOP (Optional for DSA but good practice)
Understanding of Pointers / References (how variables are passed, etc.)
‚≠ê Recommended Order to Learn
Basic Math (Arithmetic, Sequences)
Recursion + Induction Thinking
(Some discrete math here if needed)
Basic Probability / Combinatorics
(For DP/Backtracking problems later)
Big O Notation (Time Complexity Basics)
Data Structures
Algorithms (Sorting, Searching first)
üéØ Do You Need Full Math for ML Before DSA?
‚ùó No.

DSA and ML have some overlap, but DSA is more about logic + problem-solving + code efficiency.
The math for ML (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Stats) doesn‚Äôt directly cover recursion, time complexity, or graph algorithms.
But your strong math skills help make DSA easier!
‚úÖ What You Should Do Right Now (Suggestion)
üü¢ Focus:

Finish your Math and Stats for ML
(Get strong in logic, problem-solving, and thinking clearly)
When ready ‚Üí Spend 2 weeks on Discrete Math (for recursion, induction, relations)
THEN jump into DSA / LeetCode
TL;DR
üìå What You Need for DSA:

Basic math + sequences + recursion + time complexity + data structures
üìå Your ML Math will help, but Discrete Math is where recursion lives
üìå ML Math isn‚Äôt enough for recursion, but you can learn it quickly later
